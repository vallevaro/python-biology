<h1>Python for Biology</h1>

<p>This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to use Python for various biology applications. The goal of this repository is to make Python code more accessible to biology students and researchers, and to provide examples of how Python can be used to analyze and visualize biological data.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>The scripts and notebooks in this repository are written in Python 3 and use various libraries. It is recommended that you have the following libraries installed before running the scripts:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Biopython</li>
    <li>pandas</li>
    <li>matplotlib</li>
    <li>seaborn</li>
    <li>scikit-learn</li>
</ul>
