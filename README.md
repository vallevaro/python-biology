Iris Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to analyze the Iris dataset and create graphics and basic statistics. The Iris dataset is a public dataset of flower measurements that is commonly used for machine learning classification problems.

Getting Started

The script is written in Python 3 and uses the following libraries:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
It is recommended that you have these libraries installed before running the script.

Running the script

The script can be run using the following command:

Copy code
python iris_analysis.py
Script Description

The script loads the Iris dataset using the pandas library and assign it to a variable called data. The script contains two functions:

One function called analyze_correlations(data) which is used to analyze the correlations between the features in the Iris dataset and create a heatmap of the pairwise correlations between the features in the Iris dataset.
The other function is the one that was provided in the previous question which is used to create a histogram to visualize the distribution of sepal length, create a box plot to visualize the spread of petal width by species and compute basic statistics.
Output

The script will produce the following output:

A histogram of the distribution of sepal length
A box plot of the spread of petal width by species
Basic statistics of the dataset such as the mean sepal length and standard deviation of petal width
A heatmap of the pairwise correlations between the features in the Iris dataset
The correlation matrix between the features in the Iris dataset
Note

This script is provided as an example and is not intended for production use. The Iris dataset is a small and simple dataset, and the methods used in this script may not be appropriate for more complex datasets.
